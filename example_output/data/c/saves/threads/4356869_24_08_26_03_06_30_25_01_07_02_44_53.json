        "com": "Greetings, /c/itizens!<br><br>Just wanted to go over a couple of guidelines for posting on /c/ if you are new here and a friendly reminder for those who aren&#039;t. <br><br>Try to avoid making single-image requests. Making a single image thread deletes a previous thread from the last page. Please include 4 to 5 similar images in your thread to get it going. Use resources like danbooru, gelbooru or even Google Image Search. <br><br>Check the catalog to avoid making a duplicate thread. This way, we can share and contribute more images more effectively and efficiently. <br><br>If bumping a thread, please include a picture instead of just writing &#039;bump&#039; and please do not necrobump threads that have reached their image limit. This restricts the diversity and natural flow of the board. Threads are meant to come and go and sometimes they are even better the next time around.<br><br>Finally, as much as /a/ is a discussion board, /c/ is a board for sharing images. Please respect the threads of other users and they will do the same to yours as well!",
